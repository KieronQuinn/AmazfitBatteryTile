## Features
- Shows battery as a percentage, with an icon
- Shows whether it's charging in the icon
- Tap or long tap to open the Amazfit App (best used with [AmazMod](https://github.com/edotassi/AmazMod) as that has better battery info)

## Usage
- Install the [latest release](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/AmazfitBatteryTile/releases) APK on your phone:
  
  `adb install -r AmazfitBatteryTile-1.0.apk`
- Add the quick settings tile like you would any other using the settings

This app does not have a main UI, so it will not appear in the app drawer. If you wish to uninstall it, you must do so via your phone's settings
